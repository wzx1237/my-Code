Here is my code:
It mainly contains several small games that I writed.
Also, there also have some course projects I have done.

Games:
Minesweeper
-
it mainly focus on using recursion to finish "open block" part.
And for the UI, I use two different map:
One is for showing which block should be opened.
Another one is for showing where have mine

mini_star_rail
-
That is the second project I have done totally on myself.
It mainly focus on using **Abstract base class** for programming.
There are two kinds of derived class: **person** and **monster**, and one base class, **character**.

Also, I use abstract data type, stack, to stimulate the **Turn**.
Each turn has 10000 meters, and the object (person or monster) need to '**run**' on the stack.
The object who first achieve the **terminal**, (i.e. has **run** 10000 meters) would start action.

Remark:
in this project is totally my own work, without any help from other people or AI.
However, in the project star_rail, I just finish the selekton of the work, and part of important function.
For the remaining part, I use AI to assist my programming, finishing the function body part.
